A [React](https://reactjs.org/) portfolio site for my web applications. The initial HTML version can be found [here](https://github.com/MitulMistry/mm-webdev-portfolio-v1).

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

You can find the README for Create React App [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Application Info
Configured with [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Implements Bootstrap via [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).

Implements Google Analytics with [ReactGA](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga).

## Install Instructions
Node Package Manager (NPM) is used for dependencies. To install the application locally, follow these instructions:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). NPM comes packaged with it.
2. Run `npm install` in the command line while in the project directory. It will install dependencies from the [package.json file](../master/package.json).
3. To build for development and run the local dev server at http://localhost:3000, run `npm run start`. It will run the Node/Express application in the [server.js file](../master/server.js).

## Commands
`npm run start` - Runs the app in development mode.
`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the build folder.
`npm run eject` - A one time operation that will remove the Create React App single build dependency from the project.
